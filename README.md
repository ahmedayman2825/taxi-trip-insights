*Exploratory data analysis on 2017 NYC Yellow Taxi trips — uncovering demand patterns, fare behavior, and operational trends.*

</div>

---

## Overview

**Taxi Trip Insights** is a data analytics project built on the 2017 NYC Yellow Taxi Trip dataset (~2.2 MB). It covers the full data science workflow — from cleaning and preprocessing through exploratory analysis and visualization — to surface patterns that matter for transportation planning, fleet optimization, and business intelligence.

The analysis answers questions like: *When is demand highest? Where do passengers cluster? What drives fare variation?*

---

## Features

**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values, type casting, and datetime parsing
- Outlier detection and removal on fares, distances, and durations
- Feature engineering (trip duration, time-of-day bins, day-of-week)

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Trip volume trends across hours, days, and weeks
- Passenger count and ride-sharing behavior
- Distance vs. fare relationship analysis
- Payment method and tip behavior breakdown

**Time-Based Insights**
- Peak and off-peak hour identification
- Daily and weekly demand patterns
- Temporal distribution of trip durations

**Revenue & Fare Analysis**
- Fare amount distribution and statistical summaries
- Tip percentage analysis by payment type
- Surcharge and extra fee breakdowns

**Location Analysis**
- High-demand pickup and drop-off zone identification
- Zone-level traffic concentration

**Visualizations**
- Distribution plots, box plots, and histograms
- Time-series trend charts
- Correlation heatmaps
- Comparative bar and scatter plots

## Key Insights

The analysis surfaces findings such as:

- 🕔 &nbsp;**Peak hours** — highest trip demand windows during the day
- 📍 &nbsp;**Hotspot zones** — top pickup and drop-off location IDs
- 💳 &nbsp;**Payment behavior** — card vs. cash split and tip tendencies
- 📏 &nbsp;**Distance–fare correlation** — how well distance predicts total fare
- 📅 &nbsp;**Weekly rhythm** — weekday vs. weekend ridership differences
- 👥 &nbsp;**Passenger patterns** — solo vs. shared ride distribution

---

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Interactive Streamlit or Dash dashboard for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] Geospatial heatmaps using Folium or Kepler.gl
- [ ] ML-based fare prediction model (Linear Regression / XGBoost)
- [ ] Demand forecasting with time-series models (Prophet / ARIMA)
- [ ] Automated reporting pipeline (PDF/HTML export)
- [ ] Expand to multi-year TLC data for longitudinal trend analysis
- [ ] Cloud deployment (AWS S3 + SageMaker or Google Colab integration)
